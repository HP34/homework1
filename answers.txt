What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
The difference between the two is that merge combines two branches and creates a new commit while rebase takes changes from one branch and applies it onto another.

What is a remote repository?
Remote repository is a version control that has the version of your project on the internet or any other network. It allows people to collaborate on projects together while working with their local copies and pushing/fetching changes to the remote repository.
